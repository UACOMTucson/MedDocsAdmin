#MedLearn - Manage Cohorts / Course Lists

To be able to enroll students in a course, you must first create a course list. To create a course list navigate to **Admin / Manage Cohorts**. 

You can manually create the class list in MedLearn, or import from a CSV. To import from a CSV, click on **Import / Export** then click  **Import Cohorts from CSV**. A sample file is available to download for reference. 

To manually create a class list, click on **Add New Cohort**. Then enter the name, type (Course List), the course the list is associated with, and select the learners you want to enroll in the course.
