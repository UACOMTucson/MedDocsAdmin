#MedLearn - Exploring the Curriculum

MedLearn provides users with an area to search and explore the curriculum. 

## Curriculum Search

Users can perform a curriculum search utilizing Boolean Search operators. Additionally you can expand the search to include files attached to learning events. You can also filter by cohort and/or academic year. 

## Curriculum Explorer

The Curriculum Explorer allows you to view curriculum content as it relates to tag sets. In addition to being able to filter by curriculum tag sets, you can filter your results by course, cohort, academic year, and choose whether you want to explore courses, learning events, and/or assessments. 

## Curriculum Matrix

The Curriculum Matrix displays a matrix indicating where certain tag sets are attached to courses. This only looks at tags attached to courses, not events.
