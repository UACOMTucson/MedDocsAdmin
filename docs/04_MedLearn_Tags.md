#MedLearn - Curriculum Tags

MedLearn has the ability to map tags to courses, learning events, assessment/evaluation items, and to other tags. 

By navigating to **Admin / Manage Curriculum** then selecting **Curriculum Tags** in the left side menu, you will see a list of available taxonomies for tagging.

**Note:** MeSH terms are not "housed" within Curriculum Tags. They are stored separately in the database. 

You can add a new taxonomy by clicking on **Add Tag Set**. To add additional tags to an existing taxonomy, click on the title of the tag set you want to add to, then you can add a tag.

Additionally, the objectives are linked to their appropriate competency. To view the linked tags, click on the link icon that appears when you hover over the objective. A window similar to the following should appear:

## What if I have a brand new objective?

1. Go to Admin / Manage Curriculum / Curriculum Tags
2. Select the tag set you want to add the objective to (e.g. Objectives / Course Name / Course, Event, or ILM Objectives / Etc.)
3. Click **Add Tag**

Return to the course, event, or ILM that you want to attach the new tag to and follow the steps outlined in the previous sections. 

## What if I need to edit an objective?

First, is the edit a **minor** change (e.g. changing the leading verb)? If so, go to Admin / Manage Curriculum / Curriculum Tags / Navigate through the tag sets to find the objective, and finally click the pencil icon that appears when you hover on the tag to edit it. 

If it is a **major** change/content change, detach the old objective from the course/event/ILM, and add a new objective following the steps outlined above for _**What if I have a brand new objective?**_

## What if I need to remove an objective?
If you just need to remove an objective from a course/event/ILM, detach the tag directly from the setup or content tab. Do **not** delete the tag from Manage Curriculum, as that will result in the tag being deleted for past years, too.
